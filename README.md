competition-examples
====================

Example competitions for the CodaLab project.

compute_pi - a competition where participants submit a value of pi to see how close they can get. 
             This is a fully working (but trivial) competition example with a scoring program and gold answer.
             
BRaTS 2012 - a competition for Brain Tumor Segmentation run as part of the MICCAI workshop.
             This is not a fully working competition because the gold/reference data is not publicly available. It is however useful for others to see how a complex competition can be constructed and hosted on CodaLab.
