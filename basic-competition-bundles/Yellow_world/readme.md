This example competition looks for submissions with "Hello World!"
It is the most basic example of Codalab competitions.
In this example, users select the submission shown on the leaderboard.
This example is based on the original "Hello World" example competition of Codalab and was modified and checked for version 1.5.

NOTE: we provide the zipped and unzipped competition bundle for convenience. In the competition bundle, subdirectories should be zipped files (e.g scoring _program).
