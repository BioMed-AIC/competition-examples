<H3>Evaluation Criteria</H3>

<p>
	The following metrics are measured:
	<ul>
		<li>Localization error: for each correctly detected vertebra (ie. the vertebra is present in the scan), the error to the reference position is computed.</li>
		<li>False positives: this denotes a falsely detected vertebra, which is not present in the scan, but falsely detected.</li>
		<li>False negatives: this denotes a missed vertebra, which is present in the scan, but not detected.</li>
	</ul>
